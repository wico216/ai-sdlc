<objective>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions.

Enables seamless resumption in fresh session with full context restoration.
</objective>

<context>
@.aidlc/state.md
</context>

<process>

<step name="detect">
Find current unit directory from most recently modified files.
</step>

<step name="gather">
**Collect complete state for handoff:**

1. **Current position**: Which unit, which plan, which task
2. **Work completed**: What got done this session
3. **Work remaining**: What's left in current plan/unit
4. **Decisions made**: Key decisions and rationale
5. **Blockers/issues**: Anything stuck
6. **Mental context**: The approach, next steps, "vibe"
7. **Files modified**: What's changed but not committed

Ask user for clarifications if needed.
</step>

<step name="write">
**Write handoff to `.aidlc/construction/unit-NNN/.continue-here.md`:**

```markdown
---
unit: unit-NNN
task: 3
total_tasks: 7
status: in_progress
last_updated: [timestamp]
---

<current_state>
[Where exactly are we? Immediate context]
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Task 1: [name] - Done
- Task 2: [name] - Done
- Task 3: [name] - In progress, [what's done]
  </completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 3: [what's left]
- Task 4: Not started
- Task 5: Not started
  </remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Decided to use [X] because [reason]
- Chose [approach] over [alternative] because [reason]
  </decisions_made>

<blockers>
- [Blocker 1]: [status/workaround]
</blockers>

<context>
[Mental state, what were you thinking, the plan]
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: [specific first action when resuming]
</next_action>
```

Be specific enough for a fresh Claude to understand immediately.
</step>

<step name="commit">
**Check planning config:**

```bash
COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=$(cat .aidlc/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"commit_docs"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[^,}]*' | grep -o 'true\|false' || echo "true")
git check-ignore -q .aidlc 2>/dev/null && COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false
```

**If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false`:** Skip git operations

**If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=true` (default):**

```bash
git add .aidlc/construction/*/.continue-here.md
git commit -m "wip: [unit-name] paused at task [X]/[Y]"
```
</step>

<step name="confirm">
```
✓ Handoff created: .aidlc/construction/[unit-NNN]/.continue-here.md

Current state:

- Unit: [unit-NNN]
- Task: [X] of [Y]
- Status: [in_progress/blocked]
- Committed as WIP

To resume: __CMD_PREFIX__resume-work

```
</step>

</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] .continue-here.md created in correct unit directory
- [ ] All sections filled with specific content
- [ ] Committed as WIP
- [ ] User knows location and how to resume
</success_criteria>
```
