```markdown
<current_state>
[Where exactly are we? What's the immediate context?]
</current_state>

<completed_work>
[What got done this session - be specific]

- Task 1: [name] - Done
- Task 2: [name] - Done
- Task 3: [name] - In progress, [what's done on it]
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
[What's left in this bolt]

- Task 3: [name] - [what's left to do]
- Task 4: [name] - Not started
- Task 5: [name] - Not started
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
[Key decisions and why - so next session doesn't re-debate]

- Decided to use [X] because [reason]
- Chose [approach] over [alternative] because [reason]
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
[Anything stuck or waiting on external factors]

- [Blocker 1]: [status/workaround]
</blockers>

<context>
[Mental state, "vibe", anything that helps resume smoothly]

[What were you thinking about? What was the plan?
This is the "pick up exactly where you left off" context.]
</context>

<next_action>
[The very first thing to do when resuming]

Start with: [specific action]
</next_action>
```

<yaml_fields>
Required YAML frontmatter:

- `unit`: Directory name (e.g., `unit-002`)
- `task`: Current task number
- `total_tasks`: How many tasks in bolt
- `status`: `in_progress`, `blocked`, `almost_done`
- `last_updated`: ISO timestamp
</yaml_fields>

<guidelines>
- Be specific enough that a fresh Claude instance understands immediately
- Include WHY decisions were made, not just what
- The `<next_action>` should be actionable without reading anything else
- This file gets DELETED after resume - it's not permanent storage
</guidelines>
